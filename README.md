# **ELEVATE** *Mountain Club*

### About This Project:
> This application is for those who enjoy the mountains. Whether you like the challenge of steep, rocky hike, a casual stroll out to a beautiful overlook point, or anything in between, your hobby has a home right here. The main project includes a trail directional system to help hikers stay on the trail that they want to be on, and can confirm within the app. The cause that we will strive towards supporting is the reforestation effort, by raising money to plant trees. On a more local level, trail cleanup events will be part of our future goals to give back to the places that we cherish. Finally, a bulletin board of local competitions and other nature-based events that will be able to be shared on other social media sites.
